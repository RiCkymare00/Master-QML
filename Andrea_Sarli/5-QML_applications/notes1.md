# Gradient Descent for QML Integrated in Neural Networks

Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning to minimize a cost function by progressively updating model parameters. In the context of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the goal is often to optimize parameters within quantum circuits. When these quantum circuits are integrated into a neural network model, the resulting hybrid system leverages the strengths of both quantum computations and classical neural learning, potentially leading to breakthroughs in handling complex, high-dimensional problems.

## Key Concepts

- **Classical Gradient Descent**: This algorithm computes the derivative (gradient) of the cost function with respect to the network parameters. Each update involves moving the parameters in the direction of steepest descent (i.e., opposite to the gradient), iteratively steering the model toward the minimum of the function.
- **Quantum Machine Learning and Parameterized Quantum Circuits**: QML utilizes quantum circuits with adjustable parameters. The probabilistic and nonlinear characteristics of these circuits introduce new challenges in gradient computation, requiring innovative techniques beyond classical methods.
- **Hybrid Neural Networks**: Integrating quantum circuits into classical neural networks creates hybrid models. These models simultaneously optimize both classical and quantum parameters, demanding specialized approaches to ensure efficient convergence.

## Parametrized Quantum Circuits in Gradient Descent

In quantum machine learning, parameterized quantum circuits are essential for encoding data and performing computations. The quantum observable $J(\theta)$, as shown in the formula, depends on parameters $\theta$ and includes trigonometric components such as $\cos^2(\theta)$, $\sin^2(\theta)$, and mixed terms like $\cos(\theta)\sin(\theta)$. These terms arise naturally from the structure of quantum gates and their action on quantum states, and their decomposition is crucial for analyzing and optimizing quantum models using gradient-based methods.

### General Formulation

The observable $J(\theta)$ can be expressed as:
$$
J(\theta) = a(x) \cos^2(\theta) + b(x) \sin^2(\theta) + c(x) \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta)
$$
Where:
- \( a(x), b(x), c(x) \) are functions of the input \( x \),
- The trigonometric terms are derived from quantum operations.

### Trigonometric Decomposition

Using trigonometric identities, the terms can be rewritten as:
$$
\cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}, \quad \sin^2(\theta) = \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}, \quad \cos(\theta)\sin(\theta) = \frac{\sin(2\theta)}{2}
$$

This decomposition is useful for simplifying gradient calculations during optimization.

### Gradient Descent Application

To optimize $ J(\theta)$, the gradient descent algorithm computes the derivative $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta}$. For parameterized quantum circuits, this often involves techniques such as:

- **Parameter-Shift Rule**: A quantum-specific method to compute gradients by evaluating the circuit at shifted parameter values.
- **Finite Differences**: Approximating gradients using small perturbations in $\theta$.

The update rule for the parameter is typically:
$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta}
$$
where $\eta$ is the learning rate. This iterative process continues until convergence, allowing the model to find optimal parameter values.

### Integration in Neural Networks

When integrated into a hybrid neural network, $J(\theta)$ serves as a quantum layer, contributing to the overall cost function. The optimization process involves:
1. Computing gradients for both classical and quantum parameters.
2. Updating parameters iteratively to minimize the cost function.

This approach enables the hybrid model to leverage quantum computations

## Gradient Estimation in Quantum Machine Learning

In quantum machine learning, the gradient of a cost function with respect to quantum circuit parameters is often computed using the **parameter-shift rule**, which provides an unbiased estimator of the gradient. The formula depicted in the image represents this concept.

### Gradient Formula

The gradient $\nabla g$ can be expressed as:
$$
\nabla g = \mathbb{E} \left( \frac{O^+ - O^-}{\sin(\phi)} \right)
$$
Where:
- $O^+$ and $O^-$ are the expectation values of the observable measured at shifted parameter values $\theta + \phi$ and $\theta - \phi$, respectively.
- $\phi$ is the shift angle applied to the parameter.
- $\mathbb{E}$ denotes the empirical average over measurement shots.



- **Shot Noise**: The accuracy of the gradient depends on the number of measurement shots, which can introduce noise.
- **Computational Cost**: Evaluating $O^+$ and $O^-$ requires multiple executions of the quantum circuit, increasing computational overhead.

This approach is foundational to training parameterized quantum circuits and integrating

## Cost Function and Gradient Derivation

In quantum machine learning, the cost function $C(\theta)$ and its gradient $\frac{\partial C}{\partial \theta_j}$ are essential for optimizing parameterized quantum circuits. The formulas depicted in the image provide a detailed derivation.

### Cost Function

The cost function $C(\theta)$ is defined as:
$$
C(\theta) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{x,y} \left( 1 - \frac{1 + (-1)^y J_\theta(x)}{2} \right)
$$
Where:
- $T$ is the total number of samples,
- $x$ and $y$ represent the input and output data,
- $J_\theta(x)$ is the quantum observable dependent on the parameters $\theta$.

### Gradient of the Cost Function

The gradient $\frac{\partial C}{\partial \theta_j}$ is derived as:
$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \theta_j} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{x,y} (-1)^y \left( J_{\theta + \frac{\pi}{2} e_j}(x) - J_{\theta - \frac{\pi}{2} e_j}(x) \right)
$$
Where:
- $e_j$ is the unit vector corresponding to the parameter $\theta_j$,
- $J_{\theta + \frac{\pi}{2} e_j}(x)$ and $J_{\theta - \frac{\pi}{2} e_j}(x)$ are the observables measured at shifted parameter values.

### Simplified Expression

The gradient can be expressed in terms of the cost function evaluated at shifted parameters:
$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \theta_j} = C\left(\theta + \frac{\pi}{2} e_j\right)
$$

### Key Insights

- **Parameter-Shift Rule**: The gradient computation relies on evaluating the cost function at shifted parameter values, which is a standard approach in quantum optimization.
- **Efficiency**: This method avoids direct computation of derivatives, leveraging quantum measurements instead.

These formulas are foundational for training parameterized quantum circuits in hybrid quantum

## Barren Plateau Problem

One of the major challenges in training parameterized quantum circuits is the **Barren Plateau** phenomenon. This issue arises when the gradient of the cost function becomes exponentially small as the number of parameters or the depth of the quantum circuit increases. It significantly hampers the optimization process, making it difficult for gradient-based methods to converge.

### Causes of Barren Plateaus

1. **Circuit Depth**: As the depth of the quantum circuit grows, the parameter space becomes highly complex, leading to flat regions in the cost landscape where gradients vanish.
2. **Random Initialization**: Randomly initialized parameters often result in barren plateaus due to the uniform distribution of gradients across the parameter space.
3. **Global Cost Functions**: Cost functions that depend on global properties of the quantum state are more prone to barren plateaus compared to local cost functions.

### Implications

- **Training Inefficiency**: The vanishing gradient slows down or completely halts the optimization process, requiring an exponentially large number of iterations to make progress.
- **Scalability Issues**: Barren plateaus limit the scalability of quantum machine learning models, especially for large-scale problems.

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Layer-wise Training**: Training the quantum circuit layer by layer can reduce the likelihood of encountering barren plateaus.
2. **Local Cost Functions**: Designing cost functions that depend on local properties of the quantum state can help avoid flat regions in the landscape.
3. **Smart Initialization**: Using informed or structured initialization methods instead of random initialization can improve gradient magnitudes.
4. **Hardware-aware Design**: Tailoring quantum circuits to the specific capabilities of the quantum
