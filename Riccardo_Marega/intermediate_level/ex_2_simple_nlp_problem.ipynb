    "A core capability of Pyomo is modeling structured optimization applications.  Pyomo can be used to define general symbolic problems, create specific problem instances, and solve these instances using commercial and open-source solvers.  \n",

    "Pyomo supports a wide range of problem types, including:\n",
    "- Linear programming (e.g., using COIN-OR-cbc CPLEX, GLPK, Gurobi, MOSEK, XPRESS)\n",
    "- Quadratic programming \n",
    "- Nonlinear programming  (e.g., using IPOPT - to solve the probelm locally - or APOPT - to solve the probelm remotely -)\n",
    "- Mixed-integer linear programming  (e.g., using Coin-OR-cbc CPLEX, GLPK, Gurobi, MOSEK, XPRESS)\n",
    "- Mixed-integer quadratic programming (e.g., using CPLEX, Gurobi)\n",
    "- Mixed-integer nonlinear programming (e.g., using BARON, Bonmin, Couenne, SCIP)\n",
    "- Stochastic programming\n",
    "- Generalized disjunctive programming\n",
